# ðŸŽ­ Playwright Web component testing

> **Note**
> The API has been designed to closely resemble Playwright's API wherever applicable. This library is _(without guarantee)_ aimed at facilitating a smooth transition to Playwright once it offers official support for Web components. It is important to take into account that this library will reach end of life when Playwright has official support for Web component testing.
> 
> To push for official support, feedback in the form of github issues and or stars is appreciated!

# Capabilities

- Run tests fast, in parallel and optionally [over multiple machines](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding).
- Run the test accross multiple _real_ desktop and mobile browsers.
- Full support for shadow DOM, multiple origins, (i)frames, tabs and contexts.
- Minimizes flakyness, due to auto waiting, web first assertions and ensures that every test runs in full isolation.
- Advanced [emulation capabilities](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation) such as modifying screen size, color scheme and [the network](https://playwright.dev/docs/mock-browser-apis).
- [Visual regression testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/screenshots).
- Full zero-configuration TypeScript support.

Along with all these âœ¨ awesome capabilities âœ¨ that come with Playwright, you will also get:

- [Watch mode _(BETA)_](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/21960#issuecomment-1483604692).
- [Visual Studio Code intergration](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode).
- [UI mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode) for debuging tests with a time travel experience complete with watch mode.
- [Playwright Tracing](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro) for post-mortem debugging.
- [Playwright Test Code generation](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro) to record and generate tests suites.

## Usage

Initialize Playwright Web component testing with PNPM, NPM or Yarn and follow the installation steps:

```sh
pnpm dlx create-playwright-sand4rt --ct
```
```sh
npm init playwright-sand4rt@latest -- --ct
```
```sh
yarn create playwright-sand4rt --ct
```

Now you can start creating your tests:

```ts
// Button.ts
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';
import { customElement, property } from 'lit/decorators.js';

@customElement('button-component')
export class Button extends LitElement {
  @property({ type: String })
  title!: string;

  render() {
    return html`<button>${this.title}</button>`;
  }
}
```

```jsx
// Button.test.ts
import { test, expect } from '@sand4rt/experimental-ct-web';
import { Button } from './components/Button';

test('render props', async ({ mount }) => {
  const component = await mount(Button, {
    props: {
      title: 'Submit',
    },
  });
  await expect(component).toContainText('Submit');
});
```

See the official [playwright component testing documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components) and the tests for [lit](https://github.com/sand4rt/playwright-ct-web/tree/master/ct-web-lit/tests) and [native web components](https://github.com/sand4rt/playwright-ct-web/tree/master/ct-web/tests) for more information on how to use it.
